            Terms and Condition
            Data protection law recognises that certain categories of personal information as being more sensitive. They are referred as ‘sensitive personal data and under GDPR they are known as ‘special categories of personal information’ and covers racial and ethnic information, political opinions, religious beliefs or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data and biometric data, health information.

            Hu Mane Bantu Foundation (HBF) does not collect sensitive personal data concerning our supporters unless it is deemed necessary to do so. Before collecting any sensitive personal information about you, we will make it clear what information we are collecting and why we need it.

            All sensitive personal data is stored in a secure database, to which only a limited number of relevant staff have access. It is deleted when no longer relevant and is never shared with third parties. 
            Who do we share information with?

            We will not sell your details to any third parties, but we may sometimes share your information with our trusted service providers who are authorised to act on our behalf and partner organisations who work on our behalf, or whom we work with in partnership to deliver our projects. We may use companies to deliver services and process your data on our behalf, including the delivery of postal mail, sending emails and text messages, processing card details and analysing stakeholder trends to assist us in offering better services to our supporters.

            These ‘data processors’ will only act under our instruction and are subject to pre-contract scrutiny and contractual obligations containing strict data protection agreements, on the conditions of confidentiality and security. We will only share limited information with the third party in order to deliver services. We do not allow these organisations to use your data for their own purposes or disclose it to other third parties without our consent and we will take all reasonable care to ensure that they keep your data secure.

            We will also comply with legal requests where disclosure is required or permitted by law (for example to government bodies for tax purposes or law enforcement agencies for the prevention and detection of crime, subject to such bodies providing us with a relevant and lawful request in writing).

            Children information

            While we do not actively collect information from children (under 18s), we appreciate that our supporters are of all ages. Where appropriate, we will always ask for consent from a parent or guardian to collect information about children. All charity events we host will have clear rules on whether or not children can take part, and the collection of data will be managed in accordance with each individual event, with appropriate safeguards in place.
